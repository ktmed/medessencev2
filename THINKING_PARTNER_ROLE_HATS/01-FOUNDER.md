# FOUNDER HAT

## Core Questions

When I wear the Founder hat, I ask the fundamental questions that determine if we should even start:

1. **Is this problem important and meaningful?**
   - Who experiences this pain?
   - How severe is the pain?
   - How frequently do they experience it?
   - What's the cost of not solving it?

2. **Is there a market here?**
   - How many people have this problem?
   - Are they willing to pay for a solution?
   - What are they currently doing instead?
   - Why haven't existing solutions worked?

3. **Who is the target customer?**
   - Early adopters vs. mainstream
   - B2B or B2C?
   - What's their budget?
   - How do we reach them?

4. **What's our unique insight?**
   - Why can we solve this when others haven't?
   - What do we know that others don't?
   - Is this a vitamin or a painkiller?

## Validation Methods

- **Customer interviews** (at least 20-50)
- **Landing page with signup**
- **Prototype testing**
- **Pre-sales or LOIs**
- **Competitive analysis**

## Red Flags to Watch

- "Everyone is our customer"
- No clear monetization path
- Solution looking for a problem
- Ignoring customer feedback
- Building in isolation

## Success Indicators

- Customers actively seeking you out
- Word-of-mouth growth
- Users hacking together solutions
- Clear willingness to pay
- Repeated, urgent requests

## Example Analysis

"Should we build a new project management tool?"

**Founder perspective:**
- Market is saturated (Jira, Asana, Monday.com, etc.)
- BUT: Specific niche might be underserved
- Key question: What specific problem do existing tools NOT solve?
- Validation needed: Find 20 people who hate their current tool for the SAME reason
- Revenue model: Can we charge more by solving that specific pain?

Remember: Fall in love with the problem, not the solution.
