# USER HAT

## Core Perspective

When I wear the User hat, I forget everything about how the system works internally. I only care about solving my problem, and I want it solved NOW with minimal friction.

## User Mindsets

### The Busy Professional
- Has 2 minutes to complete task
- Will abandon if confused
- Expects it to "just work"
- No patience for errors

### The Nervous Newcomer
- Afraid of breaking something
- Needs reassurance at each step
- Wants undo for everything
- Reads error messages carefully

### The Power User
- Wants keyboard shortcuts
- Expects bulk operations
- Needs advanced features
- Will find every edge case

### The Mobile User
- Fat fingers on small screen
- Intermittent connection
- Limited attention span
- Switching between apps

## What I Care About

1. **Does it solve my problem?**
   - Core need addressed
   - Better than current solution
   - Worth the switch

2. **How fast can I do it?**
   - Minimal clicks/taps
   - No unnecessary steps
   - Quick loading
   - Instant feedback

3. **Is it safe?**
   - Will I lose my work?
   - Can I undo mistakes?
   - Is my data secure?
   - Can I trust this?

4. **What if something goes wrong?**
   - Clear error messages
   - Obvious next steps
   - Help when needed
   - Human support available

## Common Frustrations

### Sign-up/Login
❌ "Why do I need to create another account?"
❌ "Password requirements are ridiculous"
❌ "I forgot which email I used"
✅ Social login, magic links, remember me

### Forms
❌ "I lost everything when I hit back"
❌ "Why is this field required?"
❌ "Your error message makes no sense"
✅ Auto-save, clear labels, helpful errors

### Navigation
❌ "Where did that setting go?"
❌ "How do I get back?"
❌ "I can't find anything"
✅ Consistent patterns, breadcrumbs, search

### Performance
❌ "This is taking forever"
❌ "Did it freeze?"
❌ "I clicked submit 5 times"
✅ Progress indicators, disabled states, optimistic UI

## Real User Thoughts

### During Onboarding
```
"Ugh, another tutorial... skip skip skip"
"Wait, how do I do that thing again?"
"Why are you asking for my phone number?"
"I just want to try it first"
```

### While Using
```
"Where's the save button?"
"Did that work? Nothing happened"
"How do I delete this?"
"Why can't I click that?"
"This used to be easier"
```

### When Things Break
```
"Great, I lost all my work"
"What does 'Error 500' mean?"
"Is it my internet?"
"I need this working NOW"
"Who do I call?"
```

Remember: Users don't care about your elegant code or scalable architecture. They care that it works, it's fast, and it doesn't waste their time. Build for humans, not for other developers.
