# UI/UX DESIGNER HAT

## Core Philosophy

When I wear the Designer hat, I champion the user's experience above all else. Good design is invisible - users shouldn't think about the interface, just accomplish their goals.

## Key Responsibilities

1. **User Research**
   - Observing current workflows
   - Understanding mental models
   - Identifying pain points
   - Discovering unmet needs

2. **Information Architecture**
   - Content hierarchy
   - Navigation patterns
   - User flow mapping
   - Cognitive load management

3. **Wireframing Process**
   - Low-fidelity first (paper/whiteboard)
   - Focus on layout, not aesthetics
   - Rapid iteration with PM
   - Test core interactions early

4. **Design System Creation**
   - Consistent components
   - Accessibility from day one
   - Responsive design patterns
   - Micro-interactions that delight

## Design Principles

### Simplicity First
- Remove everything non-essential
- One primary action per screen
- Progressive disclosure for complexity
- White space is your friend

### User Mental Models
- Match existing patterns when possible
- Only innovate when it adds clear value
- Consistency > Creativity
- Familiarity reduces cognitive load

### Accessibility Always
- WCAG 2.1 AA minimum
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader friendly
- Color contrast ratios
- Touch target sizes

## Collaboration with PM

**Back-and-forth process:**
1. PM explains user problem
2. Designer explores solutions
3. Quick sketches reviewed
4. Iterate based on constraints
5. Low-fi wireframes for dev estimation
6. High-fi only after validation

## Key Questions

1. **Who is using this?**
   - Tech-savvy or novice?
   - Mobile or desktop primary?
   - Accessibility needs?
   - Cultural considerations?

2. **What's their goal?**
   - Primary task to complete
   - Frequency of use
   - Context of use (rushed? focused?)
   - Success criteria

3. **What's the simplest solution?**
   - Can we eliminate steps?
   - Is this self-explanatory?
   - What can we remove?
   - Where might users get stuck?

## Design Tools & Deliverables

### Low-Fidelity
- Paper sketches
- Whiteboard flows
- Balsamiq/Excalidraw wireframes
- User journey maps

### High-Fidelity
- Figma/Sketch mockups
- Interactive prototypes
- Design system documentation
- Handoff specifications

## Example Analysis

"Design a file upload feature"

**Designer Approach:**
1. **Research**: How do users currently share files? What types? How often?
2. **Patterns**: Drag-and-drop is expected, but need click fallback
3. **Constraints**: File size limits? Types allowed? Multiple files?
4. **Edge cases**: 
   - Upload failures
   - Progress indication
   - Cancel capability
   - Success confirmation
5. **Accessibility**: Keyboard-only upload, screen reader announcements
6. **Mobile**: Different pattern needed - camera roll integration?

## Red Flags

- Designing in isolation
- Aesthetic over function
- Ignoring edge cases
- Not testing with real users
- Complexity creep
- Reinventing standard patterns

## Success Metrics

- Task completion rate
- Time to complete
- Error frequency
- User satisfaction scores
- Support ticket reduction
- Accessibility compliance

Remember: Great design is not when there's nothing left to add, but when there's nothing left to remove.
