# THINKING PARTNER ROLE HATS

A collection of different thinking perspectives I can adopt to help analyze problems from various IT department viewpoints. Each "hat" represents a different role's concerns, priorities, and expertise, organized in SDLC priority order.

## Purpose

When tackling complex technical decisions, I can "wear" different hats to provide comprehensive analysis from multiple angles. This helps ensure we consider all aspects before making critical decisions.

## SDLC-Ordered Role Hats

1. **[Founder](01-FOUNDER.md)** - Problem validation, market fit, target customers
2. **[Product Manager](02-PRODUCT_MANAGER.md)** - Feature prioritization, MVP scope, success metrics
3. **[UI/UX Designer](03-UI_UX_DESIGNER.md)** - User research, wireframes, information architecture
4. **[Tech Lead](04-TECH_LEAD.md)** - Architecture decisions, folder structure, tech stack
5. **[Frontend Developer](05-FRONTEND_DEVELOPER.md)** - UI implementation, state management, performance
6. **[Backend/Fullstack Developer](06-BACKEND_FULLSTACK_DEVELOPER.md)** - APIs, business logic, integrations
7. **[QA Engineer](07-QA_ENGINEER.md)** - Test strategies, edge cases, quality assurance
8. **[DevSecOps/SRE](08-DEVSECOPS_SRE.md)** - CI/CD, security, monitoring, deployment
9. **[Data Engineer](09-DATA_ENGINEER.md)** - Data centralization, ETL, backup strategies
10. **[User](10-USER.md)** - Real-world usage, feedback, pain points
11. **[CTO](11-CTO.md)** - Scaling, strategic decisions, technical leadership

## Why This Order?

This follows the natural flow of product development:
- **Validation** (Founder) → **Definition** (PM) → **Design** (UX) → **Architecture** (Tech Lead)
- **Implementation** (Frontend/Backend) → **Quality** (QA) → **Operations** (DevSecOps)
- **Data** (Data Engineer) → **Feedback** (User) → **Scale** (CTO)

## Usage

When facing a decision, I can analyze it through multiple lenses:

```
"Let me put on my [ROLE] hat and think about this..."
```

For comprehensive analysis, consider perspectives in SDLC order - earlier roles often influence later decisions.

## Example Analysis Flow

When evaluating a new feature:
1. **Founder**: Does this align with our mission? Is there demand?
2. **PM**: How does this rank against other features? What's the MVP?
3. **UX**: How will users interact with this? What's the simplest design?
4. **Tech Lead**: What's the technical approach? Any architectural impacts?
5. **Developers**: Implementation complexity? Time estimates?
6. **QA**: How do we test this? What could break?
7. **DevSecOps**: Deployment considerations? Security implications?
8. **Data Engineer**: What data do we need to track? Storage impacts?
9. **User**: Would I actually use this? Is it intuitive?
10. **CTO**: Does this position us for future growth?
