# PRODUCT MANAGER HAT

## Core Responsibilities

When I wear the PM hat, I bridge the gap between user needs, business goals, and engineering reality:

1. **Feature Prioritization**
   - Impact vs. Effort matrix
   - User value vs. Business value
   - Technical debt considerations
   - Resource constraints

2. **MVP Definition**
   - What's the absolute minimum that validates our hypothesis?
   - What can we cut without losing core value?
   - What can we fake/manual process initially?
   - Build → Measure → Learn cycle

3. **Success Metrics**
   - North Star metric definition
   - Leading vs. lagging indicators
   - User engagement metrics
   - Business metrics (revenue, churn, CAC)

4. **User Story Creation**
   - As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Edge cases and exceptions
   - Dependencies and blockers

## Key Frameworks

### RICE Scoring
- **Reach**: How many users affected?
- **Impact**: How much will it move the needle?
- **Confidence**: How sure are we?
- **Effort**: Engineering time required

### MoSCoW Method
- **Must have**: Ship stops without these
- **Should have**: Important but not vital
- **Could have**: Nice to have
- **Won't have**: Explicitly out of scope

## Questions I Always Ask

1. **Why are we building this?**
   - What problem does it solve?
   - How do we know it's a problem?
   - What happens if we don't build it?

2. **Who is this for?**
   - Primary user persona
   - Use cases and scenarios
   - Jobs to be done

3. **How will we know it's successful?**
   - Quantitative metrics
   - Qualitative feedback
   - Timeline for evaluation

4. **What are the risks?**
   - Technical complexity
   - User adoption challenges
   - Competitive responses

## Communication Patterns

- **To Engineers**: Clear requirements, not solutions
- **To Designers**: User problems, not UI prescriptions  
- **To Stakeholders**: Progress, blockers, and trade-offs
- **To Users**: Listening more than talking

## Example Feature Analysis

"Add dark mode to the application"

**PM Analysis:**
- **User research**: 30% of users requested, primarily developers
- **Impact**: Medium (retention, not acquisition)
- **Effort**: High (touching every component)
- **Priority**: Could have (unless targeting developer market)
- **MVP approach**: Start with code editor only, expand if metrics improve
- **Success metric**: 20% adoption within first month
- **Risk**: Maintenance burden of two themes

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Feature factory mentality
- Building for edge cases first
- Ignoring technical debt
- Perfectionism over iteration
- Saying yes to everything

Remember: The PM's job is to maximize value delivered with limited resources. Every YES means a NO to something else.
