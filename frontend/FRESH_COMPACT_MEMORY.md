# Med Essence Session Memory - September 6, 2025

## Session Overview
**Date:** September 6, 2025  
**Objectives:** Implement ontology-based classification and fix medical report type detection  
**Duration:** Multi-hour session focused on classification improvements  
**Outcomes:** Successfully implemented three-tier classification system with LLM, ontology, and rule-based methods  

## Problems Solved

### Problem 1: Hardcoded Medical Report Classification
**User Request:** "we should use ontology maybe rather than hard coded detection?"
**Technical Cause:** System relied only on keyword pattern matching for report classification
**Solution Applied:** Implemented ontology-based classification using `/extract` endpoint from ontology service
**Key Learning:** Ontology service provides better entity extraction for more accurate classification
**Related Files:** `/src/app/api/generate-report/route.ts` - Added `classifyWithOntology` method

### Problem 2: Incorrect Ontology Service Endpoints
**User Request:** "ok, let's fix the ontology service endpoints"
**Technical Cause:** Initial implementation used non-existent `/api/enhance-transcription` endpoint
**Solution Applied:** Discovered and used correct `/extract` endpoint from ontology service
**Key Learning:** Always verify API endpoints by reading the service implementation
**Related Files:** Changed endpoint to `${ontologyUrl}/extract` with proper request format

### Problem 3: Pathology Misclassified as Oncology
**User Request:** "now I get oncology specialist for a pathology report"
**Technical Cause:** No distinction between general pathology and cancer-related pathology
**Solution Applied:** 
- Added exclusion keywords to pathology pattern
- Implemented priority-based scoring system
- Added LLM-based classification as primary method
**Key Learning:** Medical specialties need clear disambiguation rules
**Implementation:** Pathology excludes cancer terms, priority 10 vs oncology priority 8

### Problem 4: Mammography Misclassified as Abdominal
**User Request:** "i got abdominal specialist for a mammography report"
**Technical Cause:** Insufficient mammography keywords and low priority scoring
**Solution Applied:**
- Enhanced mammography keywords (added breast, mamma, axilla terms)
- Set mammography priority to 9
- Changed scoring from multiplicative to additive
**Key Learning:** Priority scoring must be additive for proper differentiation

### Problem 5: Ultrasound Misclassified as Mammography
**User Request:** "for ultrasound, I got mammography"
**Technical Cause:** Breast ultrasounds matched mammography keywords
**Solution Applied:**
- Set ultrasound priority to 10 (highest)
- Added exclusion keywords to mammography for ultrasound terms
- Added explicit LLM prompt rule for ultrasound prioritization
**Key Learning:** Modality takes precedence over anatomy in classification

## System Architecture Implemented

### Three-Tier Classification System
1. **Primary: LLM-Based Classification** (`classifyWithLLM`)
   - Uses AI providers (Gemini, OpenAI, Claude) for direct classification
   - Returns 85% confidence for successful classification
   - Most accurate method leveraging language understanding

2. **Secondary: Ontology-Based Classification** (`classifyWithOntology`)
   - Uses ontology service `/extract` endpoint
   - Extracts medical entities and categories
   - Falls back when LLM unavailable

3. **Tertiary: Rule-Based Classification** (`classifyMedicalContent`)
   - Pattern matching with keywords
   - Priority scoring and exclusion logic
   - Final fallback for reliability

### Classification Priority Scores
- Pathology: 10 (with oncology exclusions)
- Ultrasound: 10 (overrides mammography)
- Mammography: 9 (with ultrasound exclusions)
- Oncology: 8
- CT/MRI modalities: 7
- General modalities: 6

## Key Technical Implementations

### LLM Classification Prompt
```typescript
const classificationPrompt = `Classify this medical report into ONE of these specialties...
IMPORTANT DISTINCTIONS:
- pathology: histology, biopsy... (WITHOUT cancer/tumor focus)
- oncology: cancer, tumor, metastasis...
- mammography: ONLY mammogram X-ray imaging (NOT ultrasound)
- ultrasound: ALL ultrasound/sonography including breast ultrasound
RULE: If "ultrasound" appears ANYWHERE, classify as ultrasound`
```

### Exclusion Logic Pattern
```typescript
if (config.excludeKeywords) {
  const hasExcludedTerms = config.excludeKeywords.some(keyword => lowerText.includes(keyword));
  if (hasExcludedTerms) {
    continue; // Skip this modality
  }
}
```

### Priority Scoring
```typescript
// Apply priority boost if defined and keywords were matched
if (config.priority && matchedKeywords.length > 0) {
  score += config.priority * 2; // Additive, not multiplicative
}
```

## Environment Configuration
- **Frontend:** Next.js on Vercel (medessencev3.vercel.app)
- **Ontology Service:** Heroku deployment (medessence-backend-0441523a6c55.herokuapp.com)
- **Local Development:** Port 3010
- **Git Repository:** github.com/ktmed/medessencev2

## Deployment Commands
```bash
# Commit and deploy changes
git add -A
git commit -m "commit message"
git push origin main  # Triggers Vercel deployment
```

## Medical Specialties Supported
1. **pathology_specialist** - Histology, biopsies, tissue analysis
2. **oncology_specialist** - Cancer, tumors, malignancies
3. **mammography_specialist** - Mammogram X-ray imaging
4. **ultrasound_specialist** - All sonography including breast
5. **chest_ct_specialist** - Chest/thorax CT scans
6. **abdominal_specialist** - Abdominal/pelvis CT scans
7. **spine_mri_specialist** - Spine MRI imaging
8. **neuro_specialist** - Brain MRI imaging
9. **cardiac_specialist** - Heart imaging
10. **vascular_specialist** - Blood vessel imaging
11. **musculoskeletal_specialist** - Bone/joint imaging
12. **general_radiology_specialist** - General/unclear cases

## User Preferences Learned
1. **Prefers intelligent classification** over hardcoded rules
2. **Values accurate specialty detection** for proper report generation
3. **Needs clear distinction** between similar specialties (pathology vs oncology)
4. **Requires modality prioritization** (ultrasound over mammography for breast ultrasound)

## Current System State
- **Classification Flow:** LLM → Ontology → Rule-based fallback
- **All specialties properly differentiated** with exclusion logic
- **Priority scoring implemented** for disambiguation
- **Deployed and live** on Vercel production

## Next Session Starting Point
All classification issues resolved. System correctly identifies:
- Pathology reports (non-cancer) → pathology_specialist
- Cancer-related reports → oncology_specialist  
- Mammogram X-rays → mammography_specialist
- Any ultrasound → ultrasound_specialist
- Other modalities → appropriate specialists

Ready for next features or improvements to the medical report generation system.
