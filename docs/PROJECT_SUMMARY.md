# Radiology AI System - Project Summary

## Project Overview

The Radiology AI System is a comprehensive medical report generation platform that leverages advanced speech recognition and multi-agent AI architecture to transform medical dictations into structured reports.

## What We've Built

### 1. Core Infrastructure
- **Real-time Voice Transcription**: Implemented using Vosk ASR with support for German, English, and Turkish
- **WebSocket Communication**: Bidirectional real-time data flow between frontend and backend services
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized processors for different medical report types

### 2. Specialized Report Agents
Currently implemented agents:
- **MammographyAgent**: Handles breast imaging reports with BI-RADS classification
- **SpineMRIAgent**: Processes spine MRI reports with vertebral level identification
- **OncologyAgent**: Manages oncology/radiotherapy reports with TNM staging
- **CTScanAgent**: Handles CT scan reports with contrast phase details
- **UltrasoundAgent**: Processes ultrasound reports with Doppler findings

### 3. Key Features Implemented
- ✅ Real-time speech-to-text transcription
- ✅ Automatic report type classification (confidence-based routing)
- ✅ Specialized parsing for each medical domain
- ✅ Multi-language support (DE/EN/TR)
- ✅ Patient-friendly summary generation
- ✅ Alternative text input method (paste functionality)
- ✅ Clean, responsive web interface

### 4. Technical Architecture Highlights
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend Services**: Node.js WebSocket proxy, Python transcription service
- **Agent System**: Inheritance-based architecture with specialized processors
- **Communication**: Socket.IO for frontend, native WebSocket for services

## Current State

### Working Features
1. Voice recording and real-time transcription (German)
2. Text paste input for report generation
3. Automatic report classification and routing
4. Structured report generation for 5 medical domains
5. Patient summary generation in multiple languages
6. Real-time UI updates with transcription status
7. **NEW**: Multi-LLM support with automatic fallback (OpenAI → Claude → Gemini)

### Known Limitations
1. Some specialized agents (cardiac, pathology) are pending implementation
2. PACS/RIS integration not yet implemented
3. Authentication/authorization system not implemented
4. LLM API keys need to be provided for AI features

## Documentation Created

1. **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** - Comprehensive product specifications including:
   - Market analysis and opportunity
   - User personas and workflows
   - Feature specifications
   - Success metrics and KPIs
   - Go-to-market strategy

2. **Technical Architecture Document** - Detailed technical design including:
   - System components and data flow
   - Multi-agent architecture details
   - API specifications
   - Security considerations
   - Deployment and scaling strategies

3. **Client Pitch Presentation** - Sales-ready presentation covering:
   - Problem statement and solution
   - Live demo scenarios
   - ROI calculations
   - Customer testimonials
   - Implementation roadmap

## Quick Start Guide

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Configure environment (optional for AI features):
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Add your LLM API keys (at least one):
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key
# GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key
```

3. Start the system:
```bash
# Terminal 1
python vosk-transcription-service.py

# Terminal 2
node websocket-proxy.js

# Terminal 3
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

4. Access at `http://localhost:3001`

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. Implement remaining specialized agents (cardiac, pathology, general)
2. Add authentication and user management
3. Integrate with hospital systems (PACS/RIS)
4. Implement proper error handling and recovery

### Future Enhancements
1. ML-based report parsing using the 190k patient corpus
2. Diagnostic suggestion capabilities
3. Mobile applications
4. Advanced analytics dashboard
5. Teaching and training mode

## Technical Debt
1. Circular dependency warnings (resolved but needs monitoring)
2. TypeScript strict mode not fully enabled
3. Test coverage needs improvement
4. Performance optimization for large reports

## Project Statistics
- **Lines of Code**: ~15,000+
- **Components**: 20+ React components
- **Agents**: 5 specialized + base class
- **Languages Supported**: 3 (German, English, Turkish)
- **Development Time**: Intensive development sprint
