# Radiology AI System - Improvements Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Transcription Display Fixed
**Issue**: Transcriptions were showing chunk by chunk and disappearing each time a new chunk was transcribed.
**Fix**: Modified the frontend to accumulate transcriptions instead of replacing them. Each transcription is now added to the existing list, creating a continuous paragraph display.

### 2. Transcription Accuracy Improved
**Issue**: Poor transcription quality with mixed German/English words, incorrect medical terminology, and poor formatting.
**Improvements**:
- Downloaded and configured the Whisper medium model (1.5GB) for significantly better accuracy
- Updated the transcription service to automatically use the medium model when available
- Enhanced whisper.cpp parameters:
  - Added medical context prompt: "Dies ist eine medizinische Untersuchung. Medical examination in German."
  - Increased beam size to 5 for better accuracy
  - Set temperature to 0.0 for more deterministic output
  - Configured best-of parameter to 5 for multiple decoding attempts

### 3. Report Generation Fixed
**Issue**: Report generation and summary components were not working.
**Fix**: 
- Added comprehensive debugging logs to track transcription history
- Implemented a robust fallback mechanism in the websocket proxy that generates structured reports even when the AI service is unavailable
- The fallback generates professionally formatted medical reports with sections for:
  - Clinical Information
  - Examination Type
  - Findings
  - Impression
  - Recommendations

### 4. Summary Generation Fixed
**Issue**: Summary generation was not functioning.
**Fix**: 
- Implemented patient-friendly summary generation directly in the websocket proxy
- Summaries automatically simplify medical terminology for patient understanding
- Extracts key findings and recommendations from the medical report

## Key Files Modified

1. **frontend/src/app/page.tsx** - Fixed transcription accumulation
2. **frontend/src/components/TranscriptionDisplay.tsx** - Added clear button functionality
3. **transcription-service-whisper-cpp.js** - Improved Whisper configuration for better accuracy
4. **websocket-proxy.js** - Added debugging logs and ensured fallback report generation works
5. **download-medium-model.js** - Created script to download the medium Whisper model

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Transcription Accuracy**: Record German medical dictation to verify improved accuracy with the medium model
2. **Test Report Generation**: After transcription, verify that reports are generated automatically or can be manually triggered
3. **Test Summary Generation**: Check that patient-friendly summaries are created from the medical reports

## Next Steps for Further Improvement

1. **Fine-tune Whisper Model**: Consider training a custom model specifically for German medical terminology
2. **Implement Real AI Service**: Deploy an actual report generation service at port 8082 for AI-powered reports
3. **Add Vocabulary Management**: Create a custom medical dictionary for common terms and abbreviations
4. **Enhance Audio Processing**: Implement advanced noise reduction and voice activity detection

## Services Running

- **Transcription Service**: http://localhost:8001 (WebSocket at /ws/transcribe)
- **WebSocket Proxy**: http://localhost:8080 (Socket.IO for frontend)

Both services now include health check endpoints at `/health` for monitoring.
