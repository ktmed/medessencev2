# Gemini AI Integration for Transcription Enhancement

## Overview

The radiology AI system now includes Google's Gemini AI as a post-processing refinement step for medical transcriptions. This integration combines the robustness of OpenAI Whisper for speech-to-text conversion with Gemini's advanced language understanding for medical text refinement.

## How It Works

1. **Initial Transcription**: Audio is transcribed using Whisper (local model, German medical model, or OpenAI API)
2. **Medical Vocabulary Correction**: German medical terminology is corrected using the built-in vocabulary processor
3. **Gemini Refinement**: For German transcriptions, the text is sent to Gemini AI for:
   - Correcting speech-to-text errors
   - Improving medical terminology accuracy
   - Fixing grammatical issues
   - Ensuring coherent, professional formatting

## Configuration

### Environment Variable

Add your Google API key to the `.env` file:

```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key-here
```

### Docker Compose

The Google API key is automatically passed to the transcription service container through docker-compose.yml.

## Features

- **Automatic Language Detection**: Gemini refinement is automatically applied to German transcriptions
- **Fallback Handling**: If Gemini is unavailable or fails, the system continues with the original transcription
- **Medical Context Preservation**: Gemini is instructed to maintain medical context and not add information
- **Async Processing**: Refinement happens asynchronously to minimize latency impact

## API Response

When Gemini refinement is active, the transcription service health check will show:

```json
{
  "gemini_refiner_available": true,
  ...
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Accuracy**: Gemini's language model helps correct common transcription errors
2. **Better Medical Terminology**: Enhanced recognition of German medical terms
3. **Professional Formatting**: Text is formatted appropriately for medical documentation
4. **Context Understanding**: Gemini understands medical context better than generic speech-to-text

## Limitations

- Currently only supports German language refinement
- Requires internet connection for Gemini API calls
- Adds slight latency to transcription process (typically < 1 second)

## Future Enhancements

- Support for additional languages
- Caching of common refinements
- Batch processing for multiple transcriptions
- Integration with medical knowledge bases
